# ðŸ§  Macro-Aware Quant Forecasting Dashboard

This project combines real-time market and macroeconomic data with advanced forecasting models and an interactive Streamlit dashboard designed to provide actionable trade ideas and portfolio optimization.

## âœ¨ Features

- Real-time data ingestion from **Yahoo Finance**, **FRED**, and **MarketWatch**
- Forecasting engine with:
  - ARIMA
  - GARCH (coming soon)
  - Hidden Markov Models (HMM)
  - Exponential Smoothing
  - Facebook Prophet
  - SARIMA
  - LSTM Neural Networks
  - Hybrid model averaging (e.g., ARIMA + Prophet)
- Confidence intervals, volatility scoring, and expected return projection
- Automated trade recommendations: **Buy**, **Sell**, **Hold** signals
- Portfolio optimization using **Sharpe Ratio** maximization
- Efficient Frontier chart and interactive risk-return visualization
- Macro regime and market sentiment overlay (VIX, Put/Call Ratio, AAII sentiment)
- Strategy recommendations aligned to current macro environment
- Custom model selection by complexity (Simple â†’ Elite)
- Downloadable trade summaries (coming soon)
- Weekly refresh via GitHub Actions
