# 📈 Macro-Aware Forecasting Dashboard – Full Project Plan

## ✅ Phase 1: Core Integration & Forecasting Accuracy

### 🧠 Model Integration
- [ ] Standardize model I/O format across:
  - `arima_model.py`
  - `garch_model.py`
  - `hmm_model.py`
  - `lstm_model.py`
  - `ml_models.py` (XGBoost, Random Forest, etc.)
- [ ] Add error handling + loading indicators for each model
- [ ] Add a **master forecast aggregator** in `ensemble.py`

### 🧮 Final Signal Logic
- [ ] Implement `generate_final_signal()` using:
  - Model majority voting
  - Weighted average (based on model backtest accuracy)
  - Thresholds (e.g., min % change to trigger BUY/SELL)
- [ ] Store signal logic in `helpers.py` or `ensemble.py`

---

## ✅ Phase 2: Frontend Features (Streamlit)

### 🎯 `forecast_and_trade.py`
- [ ] Run and display all model forecasts with confidence intervals
- [ ] Show model-by-model predictions with toggle/accordion UI
- [ ] Display **final trade signal** (BUY / HOLD / SELL) with reasoning
- [ ] Add export to CSV for full forecast and signal output

### 🧩 Add Interactive Features
- [ ] Select time horizon (1D, 1W, 1M forecast)
- [ ] Model selector (checkboxes to toggle models in ensemble)
- [ ] Historical signal backtesting chart
- [ ] Show past performance of each model (e.g., accuracy score)

---

## ✅ Phase 3: Dashboard Upgrades

### 📊 Visualization Enhancements
- [ ] Interactive Plotly charts (hover tooltips, zoom, brush)
- [ ] Forecast vs. actual comparison plot
- [ ] Confidence bands around forecasts
- [ ] Candlestick price charts with overlayed signals

### 🧠 Forecast Summaries
- [ ] Summary of expected direction
- [ ] Key indicators (volatility, momentum, macro trends)
- [ ] Highlight events that could impact forecast

---

## ✅ Phase 4: Beginner-Friendly UX

### 👶 “Explain It Like I’m 5” Layer
- [ ] Add a toggle: `Beginner Mode / Expert Mode`
- [ ] Tooltips on every output (e.g., “What is ARIMA?”, “What does BUY mean?”)
- [ ] Glossary tab: Definitions of every model, term, and indicator
- [ ] Infoboxes explaining each model’s role in forecasting

---

## ✅ Phase 5: Strategy + Automation

### ⚙️ Trade Strategy Engine
- [ ] Add configurable settings in `strategy_settings.py`:
  - Risk tolerance
  - Trade frequency
  - Position sizing logic
- [ ] Simulate how the portfolio would perform using selected settings

### 🤖 Automation
- [ ] `daily_forecast_runner.py`:
  - Auto-run forecasts daily
  - Save to JSON/CSV
- [ ] Email/report generator: Daily forecast summary + trade signal
- [ ] Optional integration with brokerage API (e.g., Alpaca) for paper trading

---

## ✅ Phase 6: Education & Documentation

### 📚 In-App Education
- [ ] Add “How This Works” tab with visual walk-through
- [ ] Include real-world trading examples
- [ ] Quiz module (match signals to charts, guess next move)

### 📖 External Docs
- [ ] Add `docs/` folder for GitHub documentation
- [ ] README upgrade with feature list, screenshots, usage instructions

---

## ✅ Phase 7: Deployment & Scalability

### ☁️ Production Ready
- [ ] Optimize model speed (use caching, reduce input size)
- [ ] Implement GPU support if possible (for LSTM)
- [ ] Streamlit Cloud or custom server deployment

### 🔄 Realtime Data Integration
- [ ] Live price feeds (using WebSocket APIs like Polygon, Twelve Data)
- [ ] Realtime strategy evaluation and alerts

---

## ✅ Bonus Add-ons (Optional but powerful)

- [ ] Chatbot: Ask “What’s the outlook for AAPL this week?”
- [ ] Natural language query: “Show me all BUY signals this month”
- [ ] AI commentary summary (e.g., “Based on trends, this stock is likely bullish short-term”)
- [ ] Macro regime model integration (already in progress)
